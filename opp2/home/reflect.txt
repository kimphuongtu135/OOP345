In this workshop, I have learn new types of variable for example (chrono::steady_clock::duration and chrono::steady_clock::time_point ) in the module TimedEvent. Moreover, I have practiced with string type, size_t type, copy assignment, copy constructor. With the part at home, I have to practice with move assignment and move constructor.

During the workshop, I have a problem with 1-arugument in the RecordSet module with requiring to apply the knowledge about open file and read file. Besides, I have a problem with condition for the getRecord. With these problems, I have to review back in OOP224 notes for how to deal with open file and read file. And with the getRecord, I have problem because I deallocated multiple times in the copy assignment, and I lack of "const" so that leads to value changing and cannot compare.

The significant time of move operations is faster than the copy. The copy has to create a new object and if the implementation has a pointer which reqruies dynamic memory. The copy has to start whole the process with including allocation memory and copy the value of static variables.

But the move operation, it just transfers the value of variables to new object.It doesn't require to dynamic allocation process. 

Hence, it leads to move operation will be faster than copy assignment.
