In this workshop, I have a chance to practice the error handling by coding try-throw-catch, template, and lambda function. I have a lot of issues that caused difficulty for me in spellCheck module (constructor and checking error), in main for the loading book, movie and the collection module. I asked help from friends and re-read the note to be able to fix these problems

The difference between lambda function and a functor that functor requires a seperated class and it is more complex than lambda function. Lambda function does not require class and it is simpler to use.

The error from exception is caused because of the filename, if the user input the wrong filename or re-open the file in multiple times, it might lead to that problem. Hence, we can create an array to store all filename and loop in that array to prevent the error.

In my opinion, we can create a base class and making Movie and Book as its child class to avoid duplicate logic.

Finally, I think the default constructor is necessary. We need to keep it for avoiding the unexpected error to affect the data. Moreover, the way of design the code will affect directly to perform the program.Hence, the defaultl constructor is necessary and should be kept it.
